I have a knack for **solving problems** —especially the kind that **slow businesses** down. Over the years, I’ve helped businesses **automate complex processes**, **cut down manual effort**, and **make smarter decisions with data**. From building AI-driven forecasting models to designing intelligent workflows that run on autopilot, my goal is simple: **save time, reduce inefficiencies, and boost revenue.**

When I’m not busy helping businesses eliminate bottlenecks, I’m a **data scientist** with expertise in **predictive modeling, big data analytics, machine learning, AI Strategy, and cloud-based analytics**. I’ve built and deployed automation solutions for *Fortune 500 companies*, ensuring their operations are not just data-driven but future-proof.
